This code explains the basic understanding of time series based data prediction. The model built based on the Additive Model(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_model),nonparametric regression method. AM uses a one dimensional soother to build nonprametric regression model.

We will be learning the basis of AM for the financial data using python and Facebook's Prophet package(https://research.fb.com/prophet-forecasting-at-scale/), accessing financial data using the Quandl library and, and plotting with matplotlib.
